Peace and mercy be upon you 


God willing, I present to you a tool that performs some encryption operations and helps users who know encrypted files of all kinds of hashs and all to choose which saves the user a lot of effort from encryption operations Determining the types of encryption used for the file, and there are many options that provide you. I will explain the tool Explanation of options 


1_Hash Chacker 

The first option compares the hash types with the other hash when the user knows the file has been modified before or not 

2_Hash length 
The second choice is to know the length of the In many types of hash lengthhash, and in many of the hash lengths such as 32.64.40....In many types of hash length

3_Hash type
Three Choice Know the type of hash encryption used, for example MD5..Sha1..sha256

4_MD5 Encrypt 

The fourth option is to encrypt many of the words that you encrypt, whatever you encrypt 

5_MD5 Decrypt

The fifth option is to decrypt it MD5 from inside a file txt The user enters or chooses the word from within the file and then you choose the name of the file from which you choose the name that you encrypt 

................

And because we have finished explaining the tool, I hope you can benefit from something, a sentence of words, and thank you to everyone
